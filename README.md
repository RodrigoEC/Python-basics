# Python Basics

I truly believe that it's only possible to be really good at something complex if we fully understand the basics of the thing we're trying to be an expert in. 

Thus the goal of this repository is for me to register all of my progress "relearning" python from basic to advanced.

## About Python

### Snake Case
The standard variable name pattern in Python is called `Snake Case` and 
by that we say that variable must start with a lowercase letter and the
words are separated by a underscore ("_").

__Example:__ 
```Python
default_variable = "I'm a default variable"
```

### Dynamically typed language

Python is a `dynamically typed language` which means that we don't need to explicite the _type_ of the variables that we are creating. Because of that we can change the variable type just by changing it's value type, as we can see in the following example

__Ex:__ 
```Python
    my_name_is_julia = "Hy my name is julia"
    my_name_is_julia = 1423
```
